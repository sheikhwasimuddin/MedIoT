        answer: `🫀 ★HYPERTENSION (High Blood Pressure) - Complete Guide★

★📊 Blood Pressure Categories:
 Normal: <120/80 mmHg
 Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg  
 Stage 1: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
 Stage 2: ≥140/90 mmHg
 Crisis: ≥180/120 mmHg (Emergency!)

★🔬 Pathophysiology:
High blood pressure damages arteries by creating excessive force against vessel walls. Think of it like a garden hose - too much pressure damages the hose over time. This leads to:
 Arterial wall thickening and stiffening
 Reduced blood flow to organs
 Increased cardiac workload
 Accelerated atherosclerosis

★⚠️ Risk Factors:
 Age >45 (men), >55 (women)
 Family history
 Obesity (BMI >30)
 Excessive sodium intake (>2.3g/day)
 Physical inactivity
 Excessive alcohol
 Stress and sleep disorders

★💊 Treatment Approaches:
 ★ACE Inhibitors: Lisinopril, Enalapril
 ★Beta Blockers: Metoprolol, Atenolol  
 ★Calcium Channel Blockers: Amlodipine
 ★Diuretics: Hydrochlorothiazide

★🏠 IoT Monitoring:
Modern blood pressure monitors with Bluetooth connectivity can:
 Track readings automatically
 Detect irregular heartbeats
 Send alerts for dangerous readings

★📊 Signal Processing:
1. ★Raw Signal Acquisition: 16-bit ADC samples
2. ★DC Component Removal: High-pass filtering
3. ★Noise Filtering: Band-pass filter (0.5-5 Hz)
4. ★Peak Detection: Find R-peaks for heart rate
5. ★SpO2 Calculation: Red/IR ratio algorithm

★🔧 Calibration Process:
 ★Factory Calibration: Pre-calibrated coefficients
 ★User Calibration: Compare with medical oximeter
 ★Environmental Calibration: Account for ambient light
 ★Motion Compensation: Accelerometer integration

★⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions:
 ★Poor Signal Quality: Ensure firm finger contact
 ★Motion Artifacts: Add accelerometer for filtering
 ★Ambient Light: Use opaque housing
 ★Power Management: Implement sleep modes
 ★False Readings: Implement validity checks`,
